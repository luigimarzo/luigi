    <h2>Education</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Luigi Marzo, and I am currently a 21-year-old student in the third year of my Bachelor of Science in Management Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (Polimi), one of Italy's leading universities. I am originally from Italy, and I have always been passionate about both technology and business, which led me to pursue this challenging and dynamic field of study. Management Engineering allows me to combine my interest in engineering principles with a strong focus on management, preparing me to tackle complex problems in business environments and develop innovative solutions.

        At the moment, I am spending my exchange semester in Stockholm, Sweden, which has been an exciting and enriching experience so far. The opportunity to study abroad has allowed me to immerse myself in a new culture, meet people from all over the world, and gain a broader perspective on global business practices. Stockholm, known for its innovation, sustainability efforts, and vibrant startup ecosystem, offers a perfect backdrop for my academic and professional growth. During my time here, I am taking courses related to entrepreneurship, strategic management, and sustainable business practices, which align perfectly with my academic interests.
        
        Living in Stockholm has also given me the chance to explore Swedish culture, which is different from what I am accustomed to in Italy. I am enjoying the balance between a fast-paced academic environment and a relaxed lifestyle that Swedes are known for. Additionally, the city's commitment to sustainability and its cutting-edge tech scene have been incredibly inspiring. As someone interested in management and technology, I am thrilled to be in a city that values innovation and is home to many world-renowned companies, especially in areas like clean technology and digital solutions.
        
        This exchange semester is not just a chance to further my academic knowledge but also an opportunity to build my global network, which I believe will be essential for my future career. I am excited to continue my journey in Stockholm and make the most of this incredible learning experience</p>

    <p>Welcome to my very first website! I’m excited to share this project with you, and I truly hope it will continue to grow and improve over time. This is just the beginning of what I envision as an ever-evolving space where I can express my ideas, showcase my work, and connect with others. As a student of Management Engineering, I’ve always been passionate about both technology and business, and creating this website is a small step toward combining those interests in a more practical and creative way.

        While it may be simple right now, my goal is to continuously refine and enhance this site, adding more content, features, and design elements as I learn and grow. Whether you're here to learn more about me, my studies, or the projects I’m working on, I want this website to become a place where you can find interesting and useful information. Over time, I plan to include more detailed sections on topics I’m passionate about, such as innovation, sustainability, and technology-driven business solutions.
        
        I’m still in the early stages of web development, but I’m eager to improve and explore new possibilities. As I continue my studies and gain more experience in the field, I’ll be updating the website to reflect my growth, both as a student and as someone passionate about tech and business.
        
        Thank you for visiting, and I hope you’ll check back soon to see how the website evolves! Your feedback is always welcome, and I look forward to making this a better space for everyone. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
